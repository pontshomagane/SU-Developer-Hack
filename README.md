   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port shown in terminal)

## üîß Git Setup

**Ready to push to GitHub:**

```bash
# Initialize git repository (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial commit: DYP Aura - AI-powered smart laundry management system"

# Add remote repository (replace with your GitHub repo URL)
